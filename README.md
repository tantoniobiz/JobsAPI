# JobsAPI
This is a project to create an open API for job tracking and job searching. The goal of the API is to provide job data to new and innovative job search tools that help people get jobs after getting laid off due to Covid.

There will two parts to this file (Work in progress):
1. A script that scrapes career pages and stores job data.
2. A REST API that will serve up company level and job level details as well as take requests to track specific career pages.

Stack:
Rest API - Golang
Webscraping - Golang
DB - I have not decided on a database yet, open to suggestions here
